      The request was properly formatted and Sock Puppet was able to process
      it.  **This does not mean that each user could be found and rated.**
      Requests for private or non-existent users will still return a 200.

      A screen name.  For convenience, usernames can be optionally prefixed
      with `@`.  Usernames can be entirely numeric, so ID numbers must be
      prefixed with `+`.  Twitter describes its rules for usernames
      [here](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/twitter-username-rules).

    description: >
      Numeric ID of this request.  Can be any integer between -((2^53)-1) and
      (2^53)-1, as these can safely be converted to a JSON `Number` without
      loss of precision.  We recommend generating it randomly.  Will be
      returned in the response's `id` field.
